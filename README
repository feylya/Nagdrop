A project for configuring Nagios with a nice front end.

It was the final project for my college project. Figured it should be shared.

Written in CodeIgniter 1.7 with jQuery, it's hugely out of date and is very badly written.

I've put it here in hope that someone might fork it and turn it into something useful.
